# WinCUPL
This is used to program the GAL20v8 chips.

Here is the install file <a href="wincupl.exe">wincupl.exe</a>

I have included some reference documents<ul>
<li><a href="CUPL_Reference.pdf">CUPL_Reference</a>
<li><a href="WinCUPL_Manual.pdf">WinCUPL_Manual</a>
</ul>
It took me a while to figure out to use the simulator..
When it first pops up, File->New, click [Design File]
select the PLD file and OK.
<p>
Then go add the signals that you want. You need to add vectors 
for the input conditions, you can click with the mouse to set them high/low
(It helps to make the columns widder and taller while doing this)
Save the .SI file for next time.
