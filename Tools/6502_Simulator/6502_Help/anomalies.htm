<P>Compared to 6502 and 65C02 microprocessors, the simulator is characterized by the following different components:

<UL>
	<LI>There is no relationship between the speed of different opcodes.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Illegal codes in 6502 mode are not executed, but cause the program to stop.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Illegal codes in 65C02 mode are treated as NOP statements and do <U>not</U> cause the program to stop.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>BRK, RTS, and $DB are privileged because one of them, depending on the settings, ends the program.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Reserved bits in the Status register (P) are always set to 1 (as in 65C02, but not in 6502).<BR><BR></LI>
