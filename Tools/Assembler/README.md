I use <a href="https://jorgicor.niobe.org/uz80as/">this</a>
assembler (originally for Z80) but has R65C02 as a valid target.
I use Ultra Edit as the editor, and add 'Tools' to call the assembler as needed.

## Simulator
There is also a 6502 based IDE including a simulator,
See 6502_Simulator section
