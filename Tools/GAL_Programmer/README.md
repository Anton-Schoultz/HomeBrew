The PC code is <a href="afterburner_w64_040.exe">afterburner w64 v4.0</a>
and the code for th Arduino UNO is <a href="afterburner042/afterburner042.ino">afterburner042.ino</a>

I used a circuit based on the one in the video (at 8:15)
to switch the 12v supply to the edit pin instead of the switchable module.

I thew it all together on a proto-typing 'hat' which then plugs onto the Arduino UNO R3.

<br>I added some convenience batch jobs GAL_Write.bat and GAL_Read.bat.
