# Retro Computer
When I started on this journey to build my own retro computer I first looked to see what others had done.
I found Ben Eater's videos extremely useful.
I like his aproach to building his 6502 machine, and will most likely proceed in a similar fasion.


## Clock Circuit
After seeing the usefulness of Ben's clock circuit https://eater.net/8bit/clock, I opted to make my own.
I opted for a somewhat different circuit, and added a power up reset.
